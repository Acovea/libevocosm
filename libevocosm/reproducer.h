        In most cases, a reproducer generates new organisms using parents
        selected (by fitness) from an existing population. In some singular
        (and probably rare) cases, a reproducer might generate new, random
        organisms in order to keep diversity high.
        Reproduction techniques can include crossover and asexual, sexual
        and (my favorite) try-sexual models.
