        A mutator applies mutations (random, usually small changes) to a
        set of organisms. Mutation is highly dependent on the type of
        organism. In traditional genetic algorithms, a mutation flips one
        or more bits in an integer (i.e., chromosome). Evolving a path for
        the Traveling Salesman Problem involves complex mutations that
        maintain valid permutations of destination points.

            A virtual destructor. By default, it does nothing; this is
            a placeholder that identifies this class as a potential base,
            ensuring that objects of a derived class will have their
            destructors called if they are destroyed through a base-class
            pointer.
